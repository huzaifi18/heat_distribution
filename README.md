# Heat Distribution and Heat Flux on Thin Plate Surfaces

---

+ This repository provides the application of partial differential equations to the case of heat distribution on thin plates.
+ This problem uses a finite-difference solution with the Laplace equation, then applies the central difference method as a numerical solution
+ Initial temperature for each side of the plate:
  + Up = $100^{\circ}$ 
  + Down = $50^{\circ}$
  + Right = $0^{\circ}$ 
  + Left = $70^{\circ}$ 
  + Middle = $0^{\circ}$
